### [careercup](https://www.careercup.com/about)

**`https://www.careercup.com/about`**

CareerCup's founding was more accidental than anything else. Back in 2005, when
Gayle Laakmann McDowell was graduating college, a friend two years younger
asked her to keep some notes on where she was interviewing and what she thought
of each company. Gayle did that, but also decided to record all the interview
questions (which you can still see). Word got out about this list of interview
questions, and pretty soon it became faster to post it online than to email
around a Word doc. (After all, engineers are all about efficiency!) Then people
discovered this page (which was, at that time, just hosted off her personal
website) and traffic grew. And then other people started to contribute their
questions. Slowly, bit by bit, it evolved into the CareerCup we know and love.

online.
