## Algorithms

### [Exercism](http://exercism.io/)

**`http://exercism.io/`**

Download and solve practice problems in over 30 different languages. Submit the
solution to the site for feedback (beta). For code newbies and experienced
programmers. Learning to program is exhilarating and challenging... and also
frustrating, exhausting, and overwhelming. Exercism provides countless small
wins. The exercises are achievable mini-quests: small and well-defined, and
with enough complexity to uncover bite-sized knowledge gaps. The solutions you
write provide reviewers with clues about what you haven't grasped yet. The
feedback you receive will guide you to relevant study topics and dramatically
increase the ease with which you write code.

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

**`https://www.codewars.com/`**

Solve algorithms from 30+ languages. Codewars is a community of developers,

## Tutorials and Education

### [careercup](https://www.careercup.com/about)

**`https://www.careercup.com/about`**

CareerCup's founding was more accidental than anything else. Back in 2005, when
Gayle Laakmann McDowell was graduating college, a friend two years younger
asked her to keep some notes on where she was interviewing and what she thought
of each company. Gayle did that, but also decided to record all the interview
questions (which you can still see). Word got out about this list of interview
questions, and pretty soon it became faster to post it online than to email
around a Word doc. (After all, engineers are all about efficiency!) Then people
discovered this page (which was, at that time, just hosted off her personal
website) and traffic grew. And then other people started to contribute their
questions. Slowly, bit by bit, it evolved into the CareerCup we know and love.

### [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/computersandtechvideos)

### [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

**`https://teachyourselfcs.com/`**

If you‚Äôre a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself to
learn computer science. Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS
education without investing years and a small fortune in a degree program üí∏.
Study nine subject areas using either the suggested textbook or video lecture
series, but ideally both. Aim for 100-200 hours of study of each topic, then
revist favorites throughout your career üöÄ.

### [Hacking a Google Interview](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php)

**`http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php`**

Learn the tricks. Beat the system.
Ever wanted to work at a company like Google, Apple, or Facebook? There's just
one thing standing in your way: the interview. But there's no need to fear.
We've mastered the interview questions and topics, and we want to show you how
you can nail every programming question. Whether you're a beginning programmer
or a seasoned expert, this class is for you. The class focuses on computer
science topics that frequently come up in programming interviews. It covers
time complexity, hash tables, binary search trees, and some other things you
might learn in 6.046. However, most of the time is devoted to topics you won't
learn in class, such as crafty bitwise logic and tricks to solving problems.
If you have any interest in working at a computer science company, make sure
you don't miss this class!

### [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-guide)

**`https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-guide`**

This is not a freaking textbook. No confusing academic jargon. No long lists of
properties to memorize. No proofs. Because that stuff doesn't help you actually
get it. Here's what does: Learning what to picture in your head when you think
of a dynamic array or a hash map. Learning how to think in algorithms. That's
what this guide is focused on‚Äîgiving you a visual, intuitive sense for how data
structures and algorithms actually work. So if you've got a big coding
interview coming up, or you never learned data structures and algorithms in
school, or you did but you're kinda hazy on how some of this stuff fits
together... This guide will fill in the gaps in your knowledge and make you
say, "Oooh, that's how that works." We'll walk you through it all, step by
step. Starting from the beginning.
